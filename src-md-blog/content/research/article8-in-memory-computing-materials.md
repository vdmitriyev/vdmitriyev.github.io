Unfortunately, there is not much materials in form of text books available that are explicitly dedicated to explain in-memory computing and in-memory database in details. That's why for a moment most valuable and usable sources of information in this domain are mainly blog articles, online courses, source code documentation and scientific publications. Please, find below links to some online courses (free once) and other useful materials. An bried technological overview can be found in following post [Innovations of In-Memory Data Management](https://hpi.de/plattner/research/in-memory-data-management-for-enterprise-systems/innovations.html).
